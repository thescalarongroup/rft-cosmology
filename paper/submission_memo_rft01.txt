Dear Editor, I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, titled \textit{“RFT Cosmology: Unifying an $f(R)$ Scalaron Field with Ultralight Axion Dark Matter”}, for consideration in your journal. This work introduces a novel cosmological model that addresses both dark energy and dark matter puzzles by combining an $f(R)$ gravity-driven scalar field (the “scalaron”) with an ultralight axion-like particle as dark matter. The paper provides a thorough theoretical formulation and discusses observable implications, demonstrating that the model is testable with current or near-future data. I wish to draw your attention to a sensitive matter regarding authorship. The manuscript is authored under the pseudonym “RFT-01” associated with \emph{The Scalaron Group}. The use of a pseudonym is a deliberate and temporary choice. The research was conducted by a scientist who, for personal and professional reasons, must remain anonymous at this time. These reasons are unrelated to the quality or integrity of the research – they pertain to circumstances that require the author’s identity to be concealed in the public domain until a later date. I want to assure you that the decision to use a pseudonym has not compromised the rigor or academic integrity of the work. All content has been developed with the utmost scholarly care, and the manuscript cites the relevant literature comprehensively. If the manuscript is favorably reviewed and tentatively accepted, the author intends to promptly reveal their identity to the journal and update the author information for the final publication. The pseudonymous submission is not intended to mislead, but rather to enable the work to undergo peer review on its own merits, with the author’s identity to be disclosed before publication. I understand that journals have varying policies on anonymity. I kindly request the editorial board’s understanding and am willing to discuss any special arrangements or provide additional assurances in confidence to the editor if necessary. The author’s ORCID and affiliation are included as placeholders in the manuscript, and these will be replaced with the correct information in due course. To summarize:
The manuscript presents original research bridging modified gravity and dark matter, potentially of broad interest to cosmology and theoretical physics communities.
The use of the pseudonym “RFT-01” is a temporary measure. The author’s true identity and credentials can be verified by the editor upon request, and will be made public upon acceptance (or at whichever stage the journal deems appropriate).
The author is committed to full transparency with the journal while maintaining anonymity in the arXiv pre-print stage and initial review phase. This strategy is aimed at avoiding any bias and managing personal constraints, and is not meant to contravene ethical norms.
I believe this work opens up an exciting interdisciplinary direction and I am eager to see it vetted by expert referees. I respectfully ask that the referees focus on the scientific content and feasibility of the model. I will readily address all referee comments and collaborate on necessary revisions. Thank you very much for your consideration. Sincerely, RFT-01
(On behalf of The Scalaron Group)
