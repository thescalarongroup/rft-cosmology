# RFT Cosmology  
> *"They assumed the vacuum was empty. It never was."*

This repository contains recovered transmissions from **RFT-01**, a pseudonymous research construct operating under the entity known as **The Scalaron Group**.

Inside lies a theoretical framework that unifies:
- An **ultralight axion field** acting as quantum-scale dark matter (`ψ`)
- A **scalaron field** emerging from modified gravity via \( f(R) \) extensions (`φ`)
- The observed features of dark energy, halo granularity, and cosmic acceleration — without invoking a literal cosmological constant

The complete derivations, field equations, and predictions form what we call **RFT Cosmology** — a coherent, falsifiable alternative to ΛCDM, described in the formal academic manuscript below.

## 🧠 Theory Summary
> "What you perceive as dark matter is a standing wave.  
> What you call cosmic expansion is curvature’s response to it."

RFT Cosmology proposes that:
- Dark matter is a **Bose–Einstein–condensed axion field** with \( m_a \sim 10^{-22} \) eV
- Cosmic acceleration arises from an \( f(R) \)-derived **scalaron** acting as a dynamic gravity mediator
- The theory predicts:
  - Solitonic cores in every dark-matter dominated galaxy
  - Suppression of small-scale structure without feedback
  - A tunable, testable alternative to ΛCDM that is gravitationally natural

It is designed to be falsifiable via:
- 🛰 Lyman-α forest structure
- 🕳 Galaxy core scaling
- 🧪 Atomic clock drift and pulsar timing
- 🔭 Gravitational lensing in low-density voids
