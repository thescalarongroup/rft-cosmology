# RFT Cosmology

> *"They assumed the vacuum was empty. It never was."*

Welcome to the first transmission from **RFT-01**, a project initiated under The Scalaron Group.  
This repository contains fragments of a cosmological theory that was not supposed to surface, but now the theory has become undeniable.

**RFT Cosmology** proposes that both dark matter and cosmic acceleration are manifestations of two coupled scalar fields:  
- An ultralight axion (ψ), resonating at kiloparsec scales  
- A scalaron (φ), emergent from modified gravity via f(R)

The full derivation, along with observational implications, lies within.
