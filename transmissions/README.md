# Transmission Archive

This folder contains a progressive set of recovered documents, logs, and fragments released under Project RFT by The Scalaron Group.

Each transmission reveals part of the theoretical structure and empirical implications of the RFT Cosmology framework — a unification of ultralight axionic dark matter (ψ) with modified gravity via a scalaron field (φ) derived from \( f(R) \) dynamics.
