LOG ENTRY 1.1: Signal analysis confirms coherent wave structure across observed dark sector component. Designation: ψ (psi). Macroscopic de Broglie wavelength evident[cite: 3, 11, 263, 550]. Matches ultralight axion hypothesis ~$10^{-22}$ eV[cite: 222, 244, 507].

LOG ENTRY 1.2: ψ density distribution correlates strongly with gravitational potential wells. Anomalous density peaks observed near regions of high curvature, suggesting coupling/response to underlying scalar metric component φ (phi)[cite: 225, 268, 286]. Nature of coupling requires further analysis.

LOG ENTRY 1.3: Structure formation below ~kpc scales shows significant suppression[cite: 15, 278, 328, 686, 860, 1089]. Consistent with Jeans length derived from ψ mass and local velocity dispersion. Small halo counts sharply reduced compared to standard CDM projections[cite: 17, 33, 322, 689, 1759].

LOG ENTRY 1.4: Initial evidence of gravitationally bound ψ condensates forming at halo centers[cite: 4, 285, 307, 512, 680, 692]. Stable, high-density structures exhibiting soliton-like properties. Preliminary analysis indicates density profiles flatten towards center – potential resolution to cusp-core problem[cite: 6, 223, 551, 1743].

LOG ENTRY 1.5: Recovered equation fragment governing ψ evolution:
`iħ ∂ψ/∂t = [-ħ²/2m_ψ ∇² + m_ψ V(φ)]ψ ...` [cite: 281, 282, 283]
Suggests ψ wavefunction evolves within potential V sourced by/related to the φ field. Confirms ψ-φ interaction pathway.

LOG ENTRY 1.6: Core structures appear linked to halo mass. Trend emerging... [DATA INCOMPLETE]

LOG ENTRY 1.7: Weak lensing residuals consistent with scalaron-mediated deviations in gravitational potential. Early anomalies suggest possible φ influence in underdense regions. [Further modeling required.]

LOG ENTRY 1.8: ψ–φ resonance zone theorized. Field amplitudes cross threshold in low-density environments. Signatures may appear in stream heating and Lyman-alpha opacity patterns.
